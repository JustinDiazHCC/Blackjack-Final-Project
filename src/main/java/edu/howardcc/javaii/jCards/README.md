- Shuffles deck of cards using a unique SecureRandom seed each time it is called
- A Player class to represent a player in a card game, providing methods to manage their hand, add and remove cards, and access their name.
- Agnostic design to allow for use in various types of card games.
- <b>DeckFactory</b> class to manage multiple decks at a time.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have `Java 17 LTS` installed

To use jCards in your project, simply include the latest version of the library in your classpath. You can download the latest version from the releases page on GitHub.

Here is a simple example of how to use jCards:

```java
import io.lyuda.jCards.Card;
import io.lyuda.jCards.Rank;
import io.lyuda.jCards.Suit;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Card aceOfSpades = new Card(Rank.ACE, Suit.SPADES);
        System.out.println(aceOfSpades);
    }
}
```

This will output `ACE of SPADES`.
